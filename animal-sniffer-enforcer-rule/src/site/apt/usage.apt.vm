Usage

  The enforcer rule offers a rule for checking projects against the signatures of an API.

* Basic Usage

** Checking a project against an API signature

  In order to check your project against an API signature, you must add the enforcer rule as a dependency to
  the maven-enforcer-plugin and then configure the maven-enforcer-plugin to run the rule:

---
<project>
  ...
  <build>
    ...
    <plugins>
      ...
      <plugin>
        <artifactId>maven-enforcer-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>1.0-beta-1</version>
        ...
        <dependencies>
            ...
            <dependency>
                <groupId>${project.groupId}</groupId>
                <artifactId>${project.artifactId}</artifactId>
                <version>${project.version}</version>
            </dependency>
            ...
        </dependencies>
        ...
        <executions>
           ....
          <execution>
            <id>check-signatures</id>
            <phase>test</phase>
            <goals>
              <goal>enforce</goal>
            </goals>
            <configuration>
              <rules>
                <checkSignatureRule implementation="org.codehaus.mojo.animal_sniffer.enforcer.CheckSignatureRule">
                  ...
                  <signature>
                    <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo.signature</groupId>
                    <artifactId>java15</artifactId>
                    <version>1.0</version>
                  </signature>
                  ...
                </checkSignatureRule>
              </rules>
            </configuration>
          </execution>
          ...
        </executions>
        ...
      </plugin>
      ...
    </plugins>
    ...
  </build>
  ...
</project>

  The example above configures the signature for JRE 1.5. For a list of other ready-made signatures, please visit the
  {{{http://mojo.codehaus.org/signatures/}Animal Scents subproject}}.

  Once you have configured your project with details of the signature to check, maven-enforcer will be able to
  throw a build error if your any of your classes reference a class, a method, or a field which is not in either
  the signature or your project's dependencies. 

  <Note:> if you want to check against
  multiple separate APIs (e.g. check against the Tomcat, JBoss, and Jetty servlet containers,
  or check against multiple java versions) then you will probably want to keep the signature
  configuration inside each of your multiple executions otherwise your project will be 
  checked against the union of all the signatures specified, which is probably not what you 
  wanted.

  {{{examples/checking-signatures.html} Some more detailed examples of the <<<checkSignatureRule>>> rule}}.
