Animal Sniffer Enforcer Rule

  The Animal Sniffer Enforcer Rule is used to check your classes against previously generated signatures.  
  This enforcer rule is called animal sniffer because the principal signatures that are used are those of 
  the Java Runtime, and since Sun traditionally names the different versions of its Java Runtimes after 
  different animals, the original project from which this enforcer rule was developed was called "Animal Sniffer".

* Rules Overview

  The Animal Sniffer Enforcer Rule has the following rule.

  * <<<checkSignatureRule>>> checks a project against an API signature.

* Usage

  General instructions on how to use the Animal Sniffer Enforcer Rule can be found on the {{{usage.html}usage page}}. 
  Some more specific use cases are described in the examples given below. Last but not least, users occasionally 
  contribute additional examples, tips or errata to the
  {{{http://docs.codehaus.org/display/MAVENUSER/Animal+Sniffer+Enforcer+Rule}enforcer rule's wiki page}}.

  In case you still have questions regarding the enforcer rule's usage, feel free to contact the 
  {{{mail-lists.html}user mailing list}}. The posts to the mailing list are archived and could
  already contain the answer to your question as part of an older thread. Hence, it is also worth browsing/searching
  the {{{mail-lists.html}mail archive}}.

  If you feel like the enforcer rule is missing a feature or has a defect, you can fill a feature request or bug report 
  in our {{{issue-tracking.html}issue tracker}}. When creating a new issue, please provide a comprehensive description 
  of your concern. Especially for fixing bugs it is crucial that the developers can reproduce your problem. For this 
  reason, entire debug logs, POMs or most preferably little demo projects attached to the issue are very much 
  appreciated. Of course, patches are welcome, too. Contributors can check out the project from our
  {{{source-repository.html}source repository}} and will find supplementary information in the
  {{{http://maven.apache.org/guides/development/guide-helping.html}guide to helping with Maven}}.
