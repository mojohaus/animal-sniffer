Animal Sniffer Maven Plugin

  The Animal Sniffer Plugin is used to build signatures of APIs and to check your classes 
  against previously generated signatures.  This plugin is called animal sniffer because the 
  principal signatures that are used are those of the Java Runtime, and since Sun 
  traditionally names the different versions of its Java Runtimes after different animals,
  the plugin that detects what Java Runtime your code requires was called "Animal Sniffer".

* Goals Overview

  The Animal Sniffer Plugin has the following goals.

  * {{{./build-mojo.html}animal-sniffer:build}} creates a signature of an API.

  * {{{./check-mojo.html}animal-sniffer:check}} checks a project against an API signature.

* Usage

  General instructions on how to use the Animal Sniffer Plugin can be found on the {{{./usage.html}usage page}}.

  In case you still have questions regarding the plugin's usage, please have a look at the {{{./faq.html}FAQ}} and feel
  free to contact the {{{./mailing-lists.html}user mailing list}}. The posts to the mailing list are archived and could
  already contain the answer to your question as part of an older thread. Hence, it is also worth browsing/searching
  the {{{./mailing-lists.html}mail archive}}.

  If you feel like the plugin is missing a feature or has a defect, you can fill a feature request or bug report in our
  {{{./issue-management.html}issue tracker}}. When creating a new issue, please provide a comprehensive description of your
  concern. Especially for fixing bugs it is crucial that the developers can reproduce your problem. For this reason,
  entire debug logs, POMs or most preferably little demo projects attached to the issue are very much appreciated.
  Of course, patches are welcome, too. Contributors can check out the project from our
  {{{./scm.html}source repository}} and will find supplementary information in the
  {{{http://maven.apache.org/guides/development/guide-helping.html}guide to helping with Maven}}.

* Examples

  To provide you with better understanding of some usages of Animal Sniffer,
  you can take a look into the following examples:

  * {{{./examples/generating-java-signatures.html}Generating signatures of the Java Runtime}}

  * {{{./examples/generating-other-api-signatures.html}Generating signatures of other APIs}}
